# librna-sys

This crate provides low-level C bindings to [`libRNA/RNAlib/viennaRNA`](https://www.tbi.univie.ac.at/RNA/).

## Current State

`librna-sys` is **highly experimental**.
It's possible building or linking does not work reliably. 
Also, currently, explicitly linking statically is not supported.

See [`librna-rs`](https://github.com/fncnt/librna-rs) for equally experimental safe Rust bindings.

## Contributing

I'm still new to Rust. If you know better and have any kind of good advice, feel free to let me know!
